# sofar-test

`yarn install`
`yarn start`


would have done:
* change page title to something relevant not React App
* nice imports (no ../../ stuff)
* mock test API calls
* colors module
* mobile styles
* test rendering result snapshots maybe, it's not particularly a practice of mine
* dockerize the app
